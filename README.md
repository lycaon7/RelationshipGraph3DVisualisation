# 3D Visualisation of Relationship Graphs

My 2023 Summer Project in the department of physics of Bar Ilan University.
The project was done in the summer between my second and third year of my study pursuing a double major in Computer
Engineering and Physics.
The project was done under the instruction of Prof. Richard
Berkovits (https://physics.biu.ac.il/en/Berkovits_Richard).<br/>

## Lists of Dependencies

1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Pathlib
4. Igraph
5. Plotly
6. LayoutBuilder
7. DataProcessor

## Usage

1. Install dependencies (Recommended using pip)
2. Run the code.
3. Insert the path to a txt file of node relations into the console when prompted.
4. Open the generated `build.html`.

NOTE: The project is built in a way to specifically accept txt files of the format that the FORTRAN simulations of
Prof. Berkovits.
An example of such a file is in the project.
