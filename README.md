# 3D Visualisation of Relationship Graphs
My 2023 Summer Project in the department of physics of Bar Ilan University.
The project was done in the summer between my second and third year of my study pursuing a double major in Computer Engineering and Physics.
The project was done under the instruction of Prof. Richard Berkovits (https://physics.biu.ac.il/en/Berkovits_Richard).<br/>

## Usage
  1. Put a txt file of node relationships into the project package.
  2. Updated the `FILE_NAME` variable in `main.py` accordingly.
  3. Run the code and open the generated HTML `build.html`.
<br>
NOTE: The project is built in a way to specificaly accecpt txt files of the format that the FORTRAN simulations of Prof. Berkovits.
An example of such a file is in the project.
